## To promote equality in all walks of life, __anti-discrimination laws should be expanded__ to cover not only employment, but all other aspects of society too.

According to the EU Treaties, the EU seeks to be a society “in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.” But currently, EU anti-discrimination laws only apply fully with regard to employment. They should be expanded to provide the same degree of protection for access to healthcare, education, and access to goods and services. In this way, the EU can use legal means to effectively promote a society in which nobody has cause to feel disadvantaged due to their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion or disability.
