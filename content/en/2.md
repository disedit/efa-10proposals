## The EU treaties should explicitly __recognise the existence of stateless nations__, historical regions, and national minorities. EU member states should be required to guarantee a __minimum level of protection and representation__ for their minority nations and communities.

We believe that all peoples have the right to choose their own destiny and an institutional framework that empowers them. Currently, stateless nations and minorities are not formally represented within the EU’s structure, and some member states deny them full recognition. For the EU to be a genuine Union of the peoples of Europe, not just the states, these groups must also have a say in the policymaking process.

The ‘Minority Safepack’ European Citizens’ Initiative received over a million signatures, and the European Parliament passed a motion in support of minimum standards for minority rights. In the face of this widespread support, the Commission must accept that its current approach to safeguarding minority rights is inadequate and needs to be expanded.
