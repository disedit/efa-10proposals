## The EU should use its soft power to __promote human rights abroad__ and stand in solidarity with oppressed peoples all over the world.

The EU is the worldâ€™s biggest economic market. This gives it a huge amount of negotiating power when it comes to trade agreements. This power should be used not merely to secure cheap access to foreign products, but to promote European values, boost democracy and encourage high quality standards in goods worldwide. Human rights clauses should be included in all trade agreements, and sanctions should be applied to countries that repeatedly violate social and democratic norms.
