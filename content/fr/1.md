## FR The EU treaties should explicitly recognise the __existence of stateless nations__, historical regions and national minorities. EU member states should be required to guarantee a minimum level of __protection and representation__ for their minority nations and communities.

We believe that all peoples have the right to choose their own destiny and an institutional framework that empowers them. Currently, stateless nations and minorities are not formally represented within the EUâ€™s structure, and some member states deny them full recognition. For the EU to be a genuine Union of the peoples of Europe, not just the states, these groups must also have a say in the policymaking process.
